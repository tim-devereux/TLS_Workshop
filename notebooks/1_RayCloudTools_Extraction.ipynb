    "This guide explains how to extract plot level forest structural information using RayCloudTools (RCT). This notebook contains commands to be copied and run within the RTC shell. If you need usage information for any of the tools, you can type the tool name in the shell to return usage information (e.g. `rayextract`).\n",

    "\n",
    "To import point cloud data to use in RCT, we use the `rayimport` tool. Some functionality within RCT uses the trajectories of LiDAR pulses to calculate density. This information is not needed to get woody volume, so we can set the ray trajectories to 0,0,-10 for all pulses using `ray 0,0,-10`. RCT also uses pulse return intensity to determine whether a pulse hits or misses, this is not needed either so we set them all to hits (discrete points) using `--max_intensity 0`.\n",

If the plot centre coordinate is not already known, we can determine this using the CloudCompare point picking tool. We already know the plot centre for our data is 2,12,0, and the plot radius is 25m. The Z upper bound is set to 30m (should be more than the tallest tree), and the Z lower bound is set as -10 to capture any data below 0. This will give us the following command which should be run in the terminal:"
