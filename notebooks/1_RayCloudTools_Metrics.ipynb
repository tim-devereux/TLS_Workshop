    "This guide explains how to extract plot level forest structural information using RayCloudTools.\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dependencies**: Ensure you installed VSCode and WSL with the RayCloudTools container.\n",
    "- **Environment**: You should have this repository open in VSCode, using WSL as the host.\n",
    "- **Data Preparation**: You should have an already coregistered plot level point cloud as LAZ v1.2.\n",

If the plot centre coordinate is not already known, we can determine this using CloudCompare. We already know the plot centre is 0,0,0, and the plot radius is 25m. The the Z upper bound is set to 30m (should be more than the tallest tree), and the Z lower bound is set as -10 to capture any data below 0. This will give use the following command: "
